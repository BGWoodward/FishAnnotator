Implement Vector of Fish, and connect the add Buttons to the actions to add to vector.
Add JSON converter/writer/reader for writing out and loading fish stats/entries?
for fish vector, get pointer to data element to read into local fish object. Then, check to make sure pointer is the same when making a modification.
	If a fish has been added, the pointer will possibly have changed, and we will need to get the new pointer to the same index. 
	Alternatively, just always get the pointer to that index, by saving the index, and doing things that way. Probably the safest bet.
		1. Get copy of element, including element id
		2. Make changes to local object.
		3. Get pointer to id, and write the changes
