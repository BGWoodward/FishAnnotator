# The GUI

This section gives an overview of the Graphical User Interface (GUI) that is used in the annotation tool. Each piece of the GUI will be highlighted, and the general functionality explained.

# Loading and Viewing Video Files

### Loading Videos

The first step in any annotation procedure is to load the video file into the software. This is accomplished by pressing the Load Video button, located on the bottom part of the GUI. Depending on video size, it may take a little while to load the video.

### Viewing Videos

The playback controls located near the bottom of the GUI allow you to move through the video in a variety of ways. The most simple is to simply hit play and the video will play at the default speed. Using the speed up or slow down buttons, you can increase or decrease the playback speed respectively. For finer control the +1 Frame and -1 Frame buttons will allow you to move through the video on a frame by frame basis. This is useful during annotation.

# Loading annotation files
If you are reviewing an already annotated file, or resuming a previously started annotation session, you can load a saved annotation file, and edit or add to it. The Load Annotation File button allows you to choose an annotation file to load. **WARNING: Be sure that the file you load corresponds to the video you have loaded, or the annotations will not line up, and it could potentially crash the software**
